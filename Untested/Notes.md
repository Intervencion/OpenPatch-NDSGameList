3690 - Made in Ore [FBC64DB7]

I can't find info about this dump. All I find is either [Made_in_Ore_JPN_NDS-Caravan [b] [2E7111B8]](http://www.advanscene.com/html/Releases/dbrelds.php?id=3785) or [Made_in_Ore_JPN_PROPER_NDS_PRESCENE [075A68D1]](http://www.advanscene.com/html/Releases/dbdswrel.php?id=3785).

So I changed it to the Proper one.

2849 - Yes! PreCure 5 Go Go! - Zenin Shu-Go! Dream Festival [BA5BF891]

I can't find info about this specific CRC for this rom. Caravan's is [Yes_Precure_5_Go_Go_JPN_NDS-Caravan [3ED94590]](http://www.advanscene.com/html/Releases/dbrelds.php?id=2919).

Unchanged however because the offsets-hexdecimals doesn't match with patch.

3966 - Dragon Quest IX: Hoshizora no Mamoribito [E86470EF] 001A7FDA: 0C → 37 & 3966 - Dragon Quest IX: Hoshizora no Mamoribito [] 001A81D8: 50 9A → 90 95

Will merge it to a single line in Untested list. ~~I'm also changing its CRC to the proper one (From [Caravan [E86470EF]](http://www.advanscene.com/html/Releases/dbrelds.php?id=4061) to [NoGroup [E8E285F2]](http://www.advanscene.com/html/Releases/dbdswrel.php?id=4061))~~

I'm not going to change CRC on Bad dumps unless I can't find info about the dump.

4187 - Idolmaster - Dearly Stars, The (DSi Enhanced) [CF9CF0E7] PUSSYCAT

Patch won't work on either. Offset/Hex doesn't match the patch.

Rudolph's patch from the AP database should work with both however. Listed on Untested's GameList.
