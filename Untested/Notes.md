3690 - Made in Ore [FBC64DB7]

I can't find info about this dump. All I find is either [Made_in_Ore_JPN_NDS-Caravan [b] [2E7111B8]](http://www.advanscene.com/html/Releases/dbrelds.php?id=3785) or [Made_in_Ore_JPN_PROPER_NDS_PRESCENE [075A68D1]](http://www.advanscene.com/html/Releases/dbdswrel.php?id=3785).

So I changed it to the Proper one.

2849 - Yes! PreCure 5 Go Go! - Zenin Shu-Go! Dream Festival [BA5BF891]

I can't find info about this specific CRC for this rom. Caravan's is [Yes_Precure_5_Go_Go_JPN_NDS-Caravan [3ED94590]](http://www.advanscene.com/html/Releases/dbrelds.php?id=2919).

Unchanged however because the offsets-hexdecimals doesn't match with patch.
